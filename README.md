# Weather CLI

Weather CLI is a command line tool which helps you to learn current forecast information of city that you specify.

On this project I used [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), Go based framework.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emrullahcirit/weather-cli
cd path/to/weather-cli
```

After you get into project directory you need to get an API Key from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/appid) then you need to creat a .env file and paste you api key into it.

```bash
go build .
./weather-cli forecast --city <city name here>
```
